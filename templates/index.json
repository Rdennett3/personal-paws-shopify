Their love of all dogs and passion for what they do is obvious and evident in all of their interations, not only with the pups but also with the pup parents. My Layla absolutely loves Kait! Actually, she adores all of the fabulous trainers at Personal Paws and can barely contain her excitement when they come to pick her up. I have complete confidence that Layla is not only safe with them but also having fun and learning essential skills. Can’t thank them enough!”\n<br>\n<br>\n-Kim Putnam-",
        "testimonialtwo": "<p>\"Kait, and her trainers are awesome. Our sunshine is having some issues with socializing with people. They have been working with her and us for about a month and we can not be more happy with how Sunshine is doing. Kait came to our house last week, and observed Sunshine, and gave us tips on things to help her and us I really see positive future for Sunshine. Look forward to Jimmy working with them 100% they are the best. I highly recommend them. They love what they do, and we love them.\"\n<br>\n<br>\n-Patty Maslanka-Fichtner-<\/p>",
        "testimonialthree": "\"Easy process to book and prices are reasonable for the care given. Staff is helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. Out two dogs and kitten were well cared for and all went very smoothly! We are able to go away with confidence that all of our pets will be content and well cared for!\"\n<br>\n<br>\n-Deb Mcloskey Hillier-",
        "testimonialfour": "\"As a first time dog owner Personal Paws has taught me and my boy so much. It’s so nice knowing that he is loved, well taken care of and having FUN! Kait has such patience with crazy, stubborn boy and he learns something new every time he sees them!\"\n<br>\n<br>\n-Steph Brown-",
        "testimonialfive": "\"Personal Paws is awesome! Our year old pup started structured walks a few weeks ago and what a difference already. Always on time and easy to reach out to if we have any questions. Their handlers are trained professionals and operate as such. Since their handlers are one-on-one with your pup we always get helpful instructions on how to communicate with our pup better after their walks. We appreciate all of their help and look forward to using their boarding services soon.\n<br>\n<br>\n-Allyson Bellinger-"
